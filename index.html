  <p class="intro">This dataset describes drug poisoning deaths at the U.S. at the state level by selected demographic characteristics, and includes age-adjusted death rates for drug poisoning from 1999 to 2015. Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision. Drug-poisoning deaths are defined as having underlying cause-of-death codes: unintentional, suicide, homicide, or undetermined intent. Estimates are based on the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files.</p>

  <h3>   Rising Death Rates</h3>
<p>These ten states represent the highest recorded drug related deaths in the United States. This line graph shows the relationship between the death rate recorded in 1999 (shown in light blue) and the death rate recorded in 2015 (shown in navy). It shows that while the overall pattern remains the same, with California in the lead, there has been a sharp increase of drug related deaths in this sixteen year period. The recorded data highlighted the high number of deaths occuring in California, and examination shows that this pattern persists today.</p>
